# Tutorial to create a DSVM on Azure and use Jupyter notebooks

In this tutorial we will create a Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) on Azure and we will explore how to access this Virtual machine and make use of the Jupyter notebooks

## Azure Data Science Virtual Machines

The Data Science Virtual Machine is an easy way to explore data and do machine learning in the cloud. The Data Science Virtual Machines are pre-configured with the complete operating system, security patches, drivers, and popular data science and development software. You can choose the hardware environment, ranging from lower-cost CPU-centric machines to very powerful machines with multiple GPUs, NVMe storage, and large amounts of memory. For machines with GPUs, all drivers are installed, all machine learning frameworks are version-matched for GPU compatibility, and acceleration is enabled in all application software that supports GPUs.

In this workshop we will go step by step on how to first create an Azure subscription, then creating a Data Science Virtual Machine on that Azure subscription and then finally access a Jupyter Notebook to develop a Data Science project.  

Please follow the steps on the Hands on Labs.


# Hands on Labs 

[1. Create an Azure account](https://github.com/joaosalvadoMicrosoft/Tutorial_Create_DSVM/tree/master/1.%20Create%20an%20Azure%20account) 

[2. Create an Azure DSVM Virtual Machine](https://github.com/joaosalvadoMicrosoft/Tutorial_Create_DSVM/tree/master/2.%20Create%20an%20Azure%20DSVM%20Virtual%20Machine) 

[3. Access the jupyter notebook](https://github.com/joaosalvadoMicrosoft/Tutorial_Create_DSVM/tree/master/3.%20Access%20the%20jupyter%20notebook)
